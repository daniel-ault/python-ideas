 
 * in curses_test.py
     - FIND A WAY TO REMOVE THE BOTTOM ROW IF IT IS WHITESPACE
	 - should be able to simply do it by splitting the string by newline,
	   removing the last row if it.strip() == "", and then resetting the
	   height of the box to it -1. This should happen in the redraw() 
	   function

 * interface should be roughly as such:
     - should display roughly similar to the TODO file in my home dir
	 - Each top-level item can have sub-items, and every sub-item can
	   have as many sub-sub- (and sub-sub-sub-... etc) -items as you
	   want.
	 - Each line (top-level or sub) can have as many lines as necessary
	   to fill in as much text as I want.
	 - navigation should be something like
	      - arrow/page keys to move up and down
		  - enter key to start editing
		  - tab key to move in one sub-level?
		  - arrow keys stay on level maybe?


 * Move db config to a separate file
 * Create scripts to create all db tables

 * command option to just output all items to stdout

 * potentially modify this to be a generic TODO editor as well. 
     - could possibly make a mode where it's just a text editor?
	   outputs to text and such? idk if that's necessary.
